#### Course Description
This course is a graduate-level, introductory course to creative programming and interactive arts, oriented toward students with some or no prior programming experience. This course will cover programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. 

We will apply and discuss computation in relation to a variety of media, such as 2D graphics, animation, image and video processing, interactive web experiences, and physical-digital interfaces. We will cover the basics of circuit design and analysis (both analog and digital), and interaction design utilizing sensors and microcontrollers. The class will provide context for these tools, and an overview of the contemporary and historical landscape of electronic and interactive art.

#### This is a hybrid class
The first and second meetings will be online using Zoom. Students will be contacted through email with the meeting information prior to the first day of class. Class sessions with an in-person option will be scheduled if it is deemed safe to do so. Online options will be provided for all class sessions. Studio access will be provided to all enrolled students.

#### Learning Objectives
* Develop programming skills for creative coding in Javascript (mainly p5.js) and Arduino. 
* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented and functional framework.
* Apply basic principles of programming and interactive electronics design for creative applications, using tools like microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and javascript.
* Understand the landscape of creative programming and apply critical thinking skills to analyze work within historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* Develop personal learning strategies, project planning, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills.

#### Course Structure 
Virtual class sessions will include:
* Discussion/Crit: Presentation of assignments, questions, discussion of reference material and artwork
* Lecture: Technical concepts, explanations of example code, & reference work -- this section will be recorded and made available to everyone
* Workshop: Exercises related to the weekly topic
* Assignments: At-home practice of techniques and methods from class, based on the homework prompt or your own idea

Virtual material (class session recordings, video and text references, class notes & code) will be comprehensive and available asynchronously. Asynchronous participation will be possible through this class github, the class discussion channel, and office hours. 

#### Github/Blog
Homework & exercises can be submitted on Github or your personal blog. 

If you miss a class where an assignment is due, please note any questions you came across or whether particular feedback would be helpful along with your code and/or documentation. Please offer and solicit feedback from the class discussion channel.

#### Class discussion channel
We will pick our preferred software and distribute a link to the class in our first session.

#### How to share 
* Sharing and borrowing code is a normal part of programming. You will learn that you can find solutions to problems, examples, and techniques online. You may want to build off of a project you find, or work a classmate has done. 
* If you are incorporating code you found online into a project, you must cite the source. This is so others looking at your code can find the original reference, and it the polite way to engage with the creative coding community. If you continue to do this kind of work, you will benefit from this habit.
* If you are building off of a significant amount of code or recreating a project, the same rule applies. It is often a good exercise to recreate or remix pieces, but you must reference the original work. 
* If you are borrowing code from or building off of work a classmate has done, the same rule applies. If it is a significant amount of code, or an idea or concept, you should take the extra step of asking permission before using their work.

#### How to ask for help
* Clearly describe what you want to happen, and what is happening instead.
* Give enough information in order for someone to recreate the problem.
* Ideally, give a link to the code itself.
* Utilize the class discussion channel to get feedback from others in class!

Any reading required for a particular week will be clearly stated in the homework section of the [weekly schedule](https://github.com/jfunky/diap-creativecomputing-fa2020/blob/master/Schedule.md).

### Grading & Attendance Policy
##### Grade Breakdown:
* Weekly homework assignments: 65%
* Participation: 25%
* Multi-week culminating project: 10%
* The last 3 weeks of the course will be focused on applying concepts from the course to create a self-defined project. You can take this opportunity to develop a new idea or revisit an idea from one of the weekly homework assignments. The completed project should demonstrate the creative use of technical skills you developed during the semester.

There is no attendance policy: if you miss synchronous class sessions, follow the schedule and assignments for the week & submit your work and feedback to classmates via other channels.
